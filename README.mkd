## 1. Project Overview

As the newly appointed data scientist for FC Barcelona, your pivotal role is to harness the power of data analytics to enhance the team's talent development strategy. <br>
Leveraging the extensive player data from FIFA 2022, this project endeavors to establish a robust classification model that can accurately recommend the optimal playing position for each youth player. <br>
By delving into the players' physical attributes and their correlation with on-field performance, the project aims to provide actionable insights to the coaching staff, fostering effective player positioning and skill development.


## 2. Project Objectives

1. **Data Preprocessing and Quality Assurance:** Thoroughly clean the FIFA 2022 player dataset, addressing missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies to ensure the accuracy and reliability of subsequent analyses.

2. **Feature Creation and Engineering:** Utilize domain knowledge to craft meaningful new features from the existing dataset, amplifying the predictive power of the model and capturing nuanced player attributes.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Conduct an in-depth analysis of the most influential features, unveiling correlations between physical attributes and playing positions, guiding feature selection and model development.

4. **Cross-Validation Strategy:** Implement robust cross-validation techniques to mitigate overfitting and optimize model generalization performance.

5. **Model Selection and Justification:** Deploy a minimum of two machine learning models, such as Random Forest and Gradient Boosting, seen in class. Elaborate on the rationale behind each model choice, considering their ability to handle non-linearity, feature interactions, and overall performance.

6. **Ensemble Modeling (Bonus Objective):** Demonstrate advanced expertise by creating an ensemble model that amalgamates predictions from multiple base models, leveraging the strengths of individual models for improved accuracy and robustness.

7. **Performance Evaluation:** Utilize appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to comprehensively assess the models' classification performance.

8. **Kaggle Competition:** your model's prowess by participating in a Kaggle competition, uploading the refined data and comparing your model's accuracy against other teams' submissions. This step provides real-world validation of your model's effectiveness
